1.  For showing the doppler-range plot, mark distances with tape and step at those
    points and wiggle a little bit to make the point cluster more visible.

2.  Also show the print text output from the terminal

3.  Show successful validation results and explain methodology
    a.  <1 dropped frame per hour: place radar in an area with lots of objects
        (more objects means more data meaning the parsing takes longer). Then
        run the profiler for 2 hours while being active in the space. Also record
        video for a timelapse and show the results.
    b.  5 meter range: place radar in a room with markings at every half meter, and
        then start moving. Record video and screen capture of the visualizer, showing
        that the detection range is as specified
